    "*from [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Russian_legislative_election#Electoral_system)*: 19th of September, 2021, Legislative elections were finished in Russia. At stake were 450 seats in the State Duma of the 8th convocation, the lower house of the Federal Assembly. Each seat is allocated through a **parallel voting**: half of the seats (225) are elected by party-list proportional representation (PLPR) with a minimum of 5% electoral threshold of number of votes that enable the party to get seats. The other half elected in 225 single-member constituencies by first-past-the-post voting (plurality voting).\n",
