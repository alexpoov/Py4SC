# Python for Social Sciences | Basics of Programming in Python 

_Aleksandr Popov, Egor Georgiev, St. Petersburg School of Physics, Mathematics, and Computer Science_

## Course Description

_Basics of Programming in Python_ is an 8-week compulsory course aimed at social science students to learn programming skills for their research. There will be weekly workshops, and weekly online course on Stepik. 

## Background 

Whether you will continue develop yourself in polititcs or reprofile to other speciality - it doesn't matter. As one man said: *'code is power, and learning to code gives you power'*. Today's world has accustomed us to generate more and more personalised data that products and projects all around the world use for personal purposes. The more you understand the possibilities of coding, the more you evaluate the impact of tech on different (even social) areas. That is the exact goal of the course: to introduce the world of coding to you, make it readable and interpreted.

We prefectly understand that you are not mathematicians or programmers. Thus, alonside with foregoing goal, we would like to narrow the scope on another one goal: decision making. It's all fun and games until you face with a challenge that requires some sort of responsibility to take a shot. Understanding the nature of data and logic behind computer code will allow you to gain an initial understanding of topics such as Data-Driven Decision Making, Games Theory, Math.Modelling, etc.

## Goals

After completing this course, students will learn:
* Basic objects and operators of Python programming language
* Loops and Sequences
* Essential Data Structures

They will also master their skills in applying new knowledge for solving relevant problems of social sciences using functional programming and decision-making programming.

## About this repository

It contains all materials for workshops and assessment tasks, including weekly quizes, homework assignments, and final exam.
