    "### Description \n",
    "19th of September, 2021, Legislative elections were finished in Russia. At stake were 450 seats in the State Duma of the 8th convocation, the lower house of the Federal Assembly. Each seat is allocated through a **parallel voting**: one ballot for party-lists and one ballot for a single candidate. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this assigment, we offer you to code down the process of election with different voting systems, including:\n",
    "* First-past-the-post voting\n",
    "* Borda count\n",
    "* Condorcet method\n",
    "* \n"

    "    * When uploading multiple solutions, the last one before the deadline will be considered final (but the previous ones can help with the appeal). \n",
    "    * Works submitted after the deadline will be penalized according to the progressive system (There is no sence to send the work 24h after the deadline, it won't be assessed).\n",
    "* **Any type of cheating will be penalized**. For example:\n",
    "    * Non-compiled code won't be considered for the assessment.\n",
    "    * Any type of copy-pasting part or all of the notebook will cause 0 both to subject and object of copy-pasting.\n",
